### Background
--- 
Betterment was established in Delaware on January 2008 by John Stein and Eli Broverman. The company's mission is to help people live better by using a smart automated investing service that provides optimized investment returns for individual, IRA, ROTH IRA, and rollover 401(k) accounts. Its technology enables users to manage their investments in a customized, diversified portfolio. As of November 2020, the company has a total funding of $275M from 15 investors that includes Citi Ventures, Francisco Partners and Kinnevik AB.

In Stein's own [words](https://www.betterment.com/resources/the-history-of-betterment/):

"I started Betterment when it occurred to me that the concepts I’d learned while studying behavioral economics and biology in college could actually apply to the many mistakes I was making in managing my own investments. While economics is good at explaining the world at a macro level, it fails to explain human behavior. At a micro level, economics assumes that humans are rational, and they’re far from rational. Especially when it comes to their money; people heavily discount the future, they withdraw when markets crash, and it’s because our emotions drive our decisions.
As the example of bad investing behavior, I was investing my money through seven different brokerage accounts. I was constantly monitoring my accounts (bad behavior) and trying to time the market (worse behavior), and the result was wasting time, taxes, and transaction costs, without making any more than I would have in an index fund (bad outcome). Our promise is to invest your money at a low cost, and manage it in a way that gives you a better outcome."

### What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve through technology?
--- 
Betterment is making investing and managing financials easier by creating an online flatform that delivers personalized financial advice paired with low fees and customer experience. The target customers are:

+ Hands-off investors
+ Retirement investors
+ Users with low balances
+ Those who want automatic rebalancing
+ Users who like goal-based tools

Betterment automatically rebalances investor portfolios when cash flows in or out — in the form of dividends, contributions or withdrawals — or when the allocation to a particular asset class drifts over 3% from its target level. The company’s algorithms check daily for a need to rebalance, and the company buys fractional shares, leaving no uninvested cash in the customer's portfolio. Betterment Premium accounts are also monitored by financial advisors, catering to those who prefer to interact with human advisors.

### The past and future of personalized investing by automation 
--- 
Customers' expectations are set by the experiences offered by tech companies. In the past 5- 10 years, consumers have required that the usage of online applications to be intuitive. As robo-adviser platforms like Betterment -- in addition to SoFi, Robinhood, and Wealthfront -- will have to continue to adapt to customer demands by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide no/low cost investment tools. In the next 5-10 years, natural language processing will allow customers to have better communication experience with robo-advisers.  Some customers prefer to self-serve their way to a risk adjusted passive investment plan. Additionally, mega large institutions now realize that they need to innovate internally or collaborate with smaller companies like Betterment to meet the needs of their tech savvy customers.
